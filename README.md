# Hackathon-FlappyBird
hackathon project to recreate flappy bird using three.js to play the game in browser in 8 hours

this was also my first time playing around with three.js so most of my time was consumed reading documentation

But I think the end result is beautiful

# Requirements

unfortuantly there are some assets that need to be loaded and will be blocked by cors if you just open the main.html file so you will need to do the following:

- open the repository in visual studio code
- install the "Live Server" by "Ritwick Dey" extension
- once installed right click on main.html file
- click the "Open with live server" button
- Enjoy :)
